Start by logging in and adding your exercises. Once you have done that, log your day's workout by selecting the exercises you did and entering the number of reps you completed.

After submitting your log, your profile will update and points will be given. You can check the global leaderboard to see where you stand, or check your personal bests on
specific exercises.
